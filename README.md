# redteam-basics

**Practical red‑team lab journal & toolkit** — safe, lab‑only automation, recon scripts, and sanitized writeups.

## Purpose
This repo documents my red‑team learning journey. It focuses on non‑exploit fundamentals: lab setup, reconnaissance automation, network scanning, packet captures, and reproducible writeups. Artifacts are sanitized for public sharing.

## Contents
- `scripts/` — small, reusable Python/bash helpers (port scanner, HTTP fetcher, recon pipeline).
- `recon/` — timestamped recon outputs (sanitized examples only).
- `scans/` — saved nmap outputs (sanitized).
- `writeups/` — short step‑by‑step learning writeups (nmap, Wireshark, recon pipeline).
- `docs/` — lab setup, notes, and GitHub Pages site.
- `notes/` — daily/weekly logs.

## Quick start
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/msr1707rich-oss/RedTeamingBasics.git
cd RedTeamingBasics
